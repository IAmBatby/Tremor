The previous team has decided to stop their development for Tremor. The mod has now been transferred to Jofairden.
Tremor is now publicly available on github: https://github.com/Jofairden/Tremor
Thanks to all the collaborators, Tremor will remain available and bugs will be fixed.

This patch was brought to you by the collaboration of Rartrin, Jopojelly and Zadum4ivii
Please report any bugs on the git, by making a new issue.
All contributions are incredibly helpful, and mentioned in changelogs.

Fixes:
 - Fixed 'Index was outside bounds of array at Tremor.GlowMask.Unload()' exception
 - Fixed Alchemist item damage modifiers, these were moved to the respective base class
 - Fixed Dice Zombie not dropping items in multiplayer

 - (Hopefully) fixed FPS dropping to 1 when viewing Tremor's mod description
