The previous team has decided to stop their development for Tremor. The mod has now been transferred to Jofairden.
Tremor is now publicly available on github: https://github.com/Jofairden/Tremor
Thanks to all the collaborators, Tremor will remain available and bugs will be fixed.

Thanks to the collaboration of Rartrin, Jopojelly, more bugs have been fixed.

Fixes:
 - Fixed 'Index was outside bounds of array at Tremor.GlowMask.Unload()'
   This was fixed by rewriting certain glowmask code
 - Fixed Alchemist item damage modifiers, these were moved to the respective base class
 - Fixed Dice Zombie not dropping items in multiplayer
 - Fixed Dize Zombie's drop chance for Rupicide

Structure:
 - Merged helper classes, removed unused code
 - Restructured a lot of folder hierachy

 Other:
 - Removed many redundant code, effectively reducing the .tmod filesize by a sizable amount
 - Reformatted most of the code
 - Written a RecipeWrapper class
 - More code has been rewritten, possibly fixing more hidden bugs
