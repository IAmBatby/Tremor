Changelogs for v1.3.2.1: (small patch)

Fixes:
 - Fixed 164 random calls that weren't random at all. They were supposed to be a 1/2 chance, but they weren't. Now they are. This mostly affects item droprates.
 - Fixed 'The type initializer for 'Tremor.RecipeData' threw an exception.'

 Other:
 - Did some more code formatting (179 changed files with 14,276 additions and 14,154 deletions)
 - Reworked code for Tremor 'Modworld' in regards to downed boss states.
 - Refactored Heater of Worlds (boss) code. With the refactor, possibly some known and unknown issues have been fixed. The boss is now also spawnable via the Heros/CheatSheet windows.
