Changelog for v1.3.2.7:

Mr Danny is back:
`@everyone Alright, so as Jofairden and I have been on good terms already for a good while already, he just proposed to open up the wiki again. The wiki however, is quite a bad source of information as of now, and there are a lot of bad pages. He asked me if I could make this post to ask if anyone right now would want to help out with the wiki, both with cleaning it up and adding new pages. If you want to help out, ping me and I will give you the wiki editor role, giving you access to the #wiki channel where you can ask questions if needed.`
This means the wiki is back in business and we are looking for editors. Go to the discord for more information.
