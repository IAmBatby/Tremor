Please note that the Tremor wiki (by gamepedia) will no longer be endorsed by me, or anyone involving Tremor's development. By no means should this wiki be considered official, and I will advise against using it. I do not deem this wiki a reputable source of information anymore, and neither should you: if you have a question, you can ask me and I will give you an honest answer.

Motherboard improvements!
 The code for Motherboards has been refactored and worked on.
 Hopefully this means there are no more multiplayer issues, or at least less. Please let me know if you encounter any.
 In addition to improvements, I have repurposed a lot of DD2 event sound effects in the boss fight to really improve on it. (thanks Skiphs for helping!)
 You will see for yourself, the additions and changes to both visual and auditive effects during the fight.

 - Fight changes
 -- Signal drones' AI is improved. They will target a nearby player and home in on them in a grid like fashion. This works together with their attack. Because of this change, the drones themselves have a hefty cooldown for hitting players with a body attack.
 -- The laser beams Motherboard shoots in her first phase now more accurately target the player, instead of random places

 - Known issues
 -- When Motherboard her two super laser beams in phase 2 have a long distance from the ground, it is known that this causes a hit on FPS. Try to fight her closer to the ground to avoid this issue, I hope I will be able to find the cause of this.
