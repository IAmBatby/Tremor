The previous team has decided to stop their development for Tremor. The mod has now been transferred to Jofairden.
Tremor is now publicly available on github: https://github.com/Jofairden/Tremor
Thanks to all the collaborators, Tremor will remain available and bugs will be fixed.

Please report any bugs on the git, by making a new issue.
All contributions are incredibly helpful, and mentioned in changelogs.
