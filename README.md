The previous team has decided to stop their development for Tremor. The mod has now been transferred to Jofairden.

Thanks to all the collaborators, Tremor will remain available and bugs will be fixed.

# Report bugs
Please make an [issue](https://github.com/Jofairden/Tremor/issues) to report the bug you found. Please check first if the mod has already been reported.
When you report a bug, please provide at the very least the following information:
* tModLoader version you are using
* Tremor version you are using
* What happens?
* What should be happening?
* A FULL log of the error(s)
  * You can get a full log by clicking on 'Open Logs' when you get the error. This log provides more information. 

If applicable, provide the scenario(s) in which the bug occurs.

# Making pull requests
Help is always appreciated. Please prepend the appropiate tag in your PR so I can easily triage it:
* [Rework]
* [Bug squash]
* [Refactor]

Rework means you reworked some code entirely. Bug squash means you have fixed bugs. Refactor or revise means you've gone over some code and refactored it. Code comments are highly appreciated.
**If multiple tags could be appropiate, it's fine if you omit them and explain in the PR itself.**

_As for now, I will ignore all rebalance requests or PRs. Rebalancing is not a priority right now._
